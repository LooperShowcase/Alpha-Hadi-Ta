        n 2005 AirAsia, a low-cost carrier (LCC) based in Malaysia, accused
        Singapore Airlines of double standards, when it claimed that the
        Government of Singapore attempted to keep it out of the Singapore
        market, despite desiring to fly routes out of Australia itself.[43] In
        2007 Singapore Airlines welcomed[44][45] the liberalisation of the
        Singapore- Kuala Lumpur route, previously restricted to Singapore
        Airlines and Malaysia Airlines under rules designed to protect the
        state-run airlines from competition for over three decades, [46][47]
        accounting for about 85% of the over 200 flight frequencies then
        operated.[48] A highly lucrative route for LCCs due to its short
        distance and heavy traffic as the fourth-busiest in Asia,[49][50]
        bringing Singapore Airline's capacity share on the route down to about
        46.7%, Malaysia Airlines' down to 25.3%, and increase to 17.3% to the
        three LCCs now permitted on the route, and the remainder shared by three
        other airlines as of 22 September 2008.[51] Until 1 December 2008,
        Singapore Airlines operated six flights per day. Singapore Airlines
        operated four flights per day plans from 1 December 2008 when the route
        was completely opened, while its sister airline SilkAir also operated
        four flights per day.[52] Malaysia Airlines, the main opponent to the
        liberalisation of the route[53] and deemed to be the party that stands
        to lose the most, continued to codeshare with both Singapore Airlines
        and SilkAir on the route.
