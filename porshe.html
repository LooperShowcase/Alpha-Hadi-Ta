      The origins of the company date to the 1930s when Czech-German automotive
      engineer Ferdinand Porsche founded Porsche[4] with Adolf Rosenberger, a
      keystone figure in the creation of German automotive manufacturer and Audi
      precursor Auto Union,[5] and Austrian businessman Anton PiÃ«ch, who was, at
      the time, also Ferdinand Porsche's son in law. In its early days, it was
      contracted by the German government to create a vehicle for the masses,
      which later became the Volkswagen Beetle.[6] After World War II, when
      Ferdinand would be arrested for war crimes, his son Ferry Porsche began
      building his own car, which would result in the Porsche 356.
