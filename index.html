      <h2>Dubai</h2>

      <p>
        Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/, doo-BY; Arabic: دبي, romanized: Dubayy, IPA:
        [dʊˈbajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation: [dəˈbaj]) is the most populous
        city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of
        Dubai, the most populated of the country's seven emirates.[7][8][9]
        Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, Dubai grew
        into a regional trading hub in the early 20th century and grew rapidly
        in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with a focus on tourism and
        luxury.[10] It has the second-most five-star hotels in the world[11] and
        boasts the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalif Dubai

        building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717 ft)
        tall. In the eastern Arabian Peninsula, on the coast of the Persian
        Gulf,[12] it is a major global transport hub for passengers and
        cargo.[13] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city,
        which was already a major mercantile hub.

      <h2>Maldives </h2>
      <p>
        The history of the Maldives is intertwined with the history of the
        broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding regions, comprising the
        areas of South Asia and Indian Ocean; and the modern nation consisting
        of 26 natural atolls, comprising 1194 islands. Historically, the
        Maldives had a strategic importance because of its location on the major
        marine routes of the Indian Ocean.[1] The Maldives' nearest neighbours
        are the British Indian Ocean Territory, Sri Lanka and India. The United
        Kingdom, Sri Lanka and some Indian kingdoms have had cultural and
        economic ties with the Maldives for centuries.[1] In addition to these
        countries, Maldivians also traded with Aceh and many other kingdoms in,
        what is today, Indonesia and Malaysia. The Maldives provided the main
        source of cowrie shells, then used as a currency throughout Asia and
        parts of the East African coast.[1] Most probably Maldives were
        influenced by Kalingas of ancient India who were earliest sea traders to
        Sri Lanka and the Maldives from India and were responsible for the
        spread of Buddhism. Stashes of Chinese crockery found buried in various
        locations in the Maldives also show that there was direct or indirect
        trade contact between China and the Maldives. In 1411 and 1430, the
        Chinese admiral Zheng He 鄭和 visited the Maldives. The Chinese also
        became the first country to establish a diplomatic office in the
        Maldives, when the Chinese nationalist government based in Taipei opened
        an embassy in Malé in 1966. This office has since been replaced by the
        embassy of the People's Republic of China.

<h1>Seychelles </h1>
<p> Victoria features a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification Af) with high 
  temperatures throughout the course of the year. The capital does have noticeably wetter and 
  drier periods during the year, with June and July being its driest months and December through
   February being the city's wettest months. However, since in no month does the average monthly
    precipitation falls below 60 millimetres or 2.4 inches in Victoria, the city does not have a 
    true dry season month. This lack of a true dry season month is a primary reason why the climate 
    falls under the tropical rainforest climate category. The capital averages about 2,300 millimetres
     or 91 inches of rainfall annually. Although being very rainy, skies are usually clear to partly
      clear and completely cloudy days remain scarce throughout the year even during the rainiest months.</p>
